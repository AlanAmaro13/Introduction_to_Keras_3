# Introduction to Keras 3

Hey there! If you're a huge fan of technology, just as I am, this notebook is for you!

This notebook will provide you a brief, and maybe not so brief, introduction to artificial intelligence. The topics covers a little about Pandas, fundamental concepts of AI, a lot of summary Keras documentation. 

So, I think this README is more like a introduction to the notebook, but the notebook is self-explanatory, so I'll let you two alone, and have fun!
